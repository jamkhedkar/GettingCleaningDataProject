Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

fBodyAcc-XYZ

These give rise to 33 measurements.


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

These are 17 features per measurement.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

These measurements were found in the X_train and X_test datasets for 30 subjects preforming activities given below. The activities are identified by their serial number below. 

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING


The data file "TidyDataPart1.txt" contains only the mean and standard deviations of the measurements got after combining the two data sets that were used to train and to test.

The steps involved were:

1. Read the training data sets, X_train (containing the measurements), subject_train (containing the subject ids), and y_train (containing the activity labels) 


2. Added two more columns, i.e., subject and activity to X_train.

3. Renamed the new X_train set

4. Repeated steps 1-3 on the testing sets.

5. Merged the two sets into one.

6. Selected only the measurements giving the Mean and standard deviations and created a tidy data file.

The data file "TidyDataPart2.txt" further divided the data in terms of each subject. For each subject, data were divided again in terms of the activity. Average of all measurements were calculated per activity per subject. The data file has 30 X 6 =180 rows as expected. 

Note that in this file the activity is listed in terms of its label not name.
